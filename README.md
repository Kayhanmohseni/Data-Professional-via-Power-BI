### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into different data professionals and their backgrounds.  
By analyzing the data from the survey taken by various data professionals, 
we seek to find any patterns in roles, countries they work in, how difficult it was to break into data, etc.

### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks: 
1. Removed unwanted columns
2. Filtered data and standardized responses to fit a category
3. Used Dax to transform the salary range column into a salary average column

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring layoff data to answer key questions below:

- What was the total amount of survey takers?
- What was the average age of the survey takers?
- What was the average salary for each data role?
- How difficult was it to break into data?
- What was the average happiness with work/life balance?
- What was the average happiness with salary?

### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The total amount of survey takers was 630.
2. The average age of the survey takers was 29.87
3. The average salary for the lowest role was 33k and the highest role was 94k
4. The majority of survey takers said it was "neither easy nor hard" to break into data
5. The average happiness with work/life balance was 5.91 out of 10
